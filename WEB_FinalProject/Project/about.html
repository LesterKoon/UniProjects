                                With the sudden boom in the Pokémon franchise over the past years, mainly during the peak of Covid-19. This store aims to attract new players 
                            as well as allow veterans to relive in the nostalgia of one of the biggest part of the Pokémon franchise, which is the... "Pokémon Trading Card Game"
                            <br><br>
                                The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a collectible card game based on the Pokémon video game series. The game was developed
                            by Media Factory and originally released in Japan in October 1996.
                            <br><br>
                                The Pokémon Trading Card Game is played between two players, each with their own deck of 60 cards. Players take turns
                            drawing cards from their decks and placing them face-down onto the playing field, which consists of six to eight "prize
                            cards" (the opponent's goal). When both players have no more cards to draw, they each flip over one of the face-down
                            cards on the playing field and compare it to their opponent's card. If they match, that player wins both prizes; if not,
                            they flip over another card from the playing field until they find a match or run out of cards. The player who collects
                            all six prizes first wins the game
